            Behind the shiny UI lies our most difficult task - comprehensive &
            annotated data. As you may imagine, a dictionary annoted with parts
            of speech, accurate definitions, example sentences and so on is no
            small feat. We are working devising a way for interested parties to
            contribute to Sajeon.
